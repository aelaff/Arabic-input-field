# Arabic-input-field
Writing Arabic letter without any problems in the runtime for input field script
This unity package has been developed to solve the problem in writing arabic words with connections, so when you used the default input field it turns the 
arabic letters in seperated and inverted letters form.
I developed this package depending on another one which belong to Abdullah Al-imam devloper but there was a problem for writing in input field at the runtime ,
the problem which solved in this package. 

# How it works
Find the prefab called Arabic Text Solver, then Put this prefab as a child of the meant input feild.
and Congrats !
